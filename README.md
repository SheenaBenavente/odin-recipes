## Thoughts 💭
WHile this is not my first coding experience, it was my first ODIN project. I found it incredibly valuable for teaching best practices and clean code standards. I learned much more about Git and Github, using Terminal (bash) command lines for creating and managing directories.  

## Tech and Tools 💻
<b>Built with</b>

## Opportunities 🚧
Practice committing to git early and often as well as best practices for commit comments. Also opportunity to strengthen understanding of keystroke short-cuts and efficient workflow. It will be important to make good habits early.
